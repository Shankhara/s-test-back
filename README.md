## The assignement

You are required to create a simple pokemon API.
This API should have a simple list of pokemons (does not need to be real or exhaustive) 
Each pokemon has a list of battle moves, a type, hp, and attack (you can add more characteristics if you understand pokemon better than I :) )

### You should at a minimum: 

[ ] Have a route that sends all available pokemons

[ ] A route to display a pokemon

[ ] A route to simulate combats between two pokemons

[ ] A route to get all combats (id, pokemons involved and winner) 


### For the combats we should
[ ] have a play by play of the combat - moves used (can be random) and health jumps of the pokemons

[ ] a winner

[ ] xp gains for the winning pokemon



You can use this api https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon-section to seed your data, but it is not mandatory. 

You will have to make choices to what and how you implement things. These choices are as important as your code.
